## The Hiddincentive

Hello, explorer! You just ***pulled*** yourself in this repo of ever-***branch***ing multiverses! Hidden somewhere here is the lost treasure called **The Hiddincentive**, but to find it, you must navigate through tangled ***branches*** and ***resolve*** all the obstacles standing in your way!

Be careful though -- every ***checkout*** leads to new possibilities, and if you're not careful, you might ***revert*** back to the start! There are ***conflicts*** waiting to trip you up, and some ***branches*** might just ***push*** you into a dead-end, leaving you to ***stash*** your hopes away.

Your task is simple -- follow the clues, ***merge*** your wits, and ***commit*** yourself to success! If you're ready, ***pull*** yourself together, ***branch*** out, and let‚Äôs find that treasure!

Good luck, and may your ***commits*** be ever in your favor!

## General Instructions

- To find **The Hiddincentive**, follow the instructions indicated in `clue.txt` for each branch you ***checkout***
- Take note of each git command you use after `git clone <rest of the command>`
- All must start here at the `main` branch
